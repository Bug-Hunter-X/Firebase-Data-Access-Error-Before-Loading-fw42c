The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the data has fully loaded. This can happen if you're working with asynchronous operations and trying to access the data before the `onSnapshot` listener has completed its execution.  For example, the following code snippet might cause such an error:

```javascript
db.collection('myCollection').doc('myDocument').onSnapshot((snapshot) => {
  console.log(snapshot.data().myField); // Error if data isn't loaded yet
});
```

The error message often doesn't directly point to the data loading issue, making it tricky to debug.
