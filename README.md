# Firebase Data Access Error Before Loading
This repository demonstrates a common but often overlooked error in Firebase applications: attempting to access data from a document snapshot before the data has fully loaded. This typically occurs when dealing with asynchronous operations like `onSnapshot`.

The `bug.js` file contains code that reproduces this error. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that addresses the issue using appropriate error handling and asynchronous programming techniques.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Make sure you have the Firebase CLI and necessary dependencies installed.
3. Configure your Firebase project.
4. Run `bug.js`. You should see an error in the console.
5. Run `bugSolution.js`. You should see the data printed to the console without an error.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that the `snapshot.data()` method is only called after confirming that the data has been successfully loaded.  This frequently requires checking for null or undefined values or using promises and async/await.
